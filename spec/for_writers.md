# vfmd for writers

This document describes the [vfmd] syntax in simple terms, and
is intended to be of help for people writing in vfmd.

The vfmd syntax is pretty much the same as the [original Markdown
syntax], with a few minor changes and added clarifications.

vfmd enables you to represent rich-text markup in plain-text files. It
uses punctuation characters as indicators of markup. It supports
block-level markup like lists, blockquotes and code-blocks, and also
supports span-level markup like emphasis, links and inline-code.

## Encoding

The input text should be in UTF-8 encoding. If you are writing your vfmd
document in English, it is most likely in UTF-8. If you are writing in
another language, please make sure that the document is in UTF-8
encoding (for example, if you are using a text editor to write the
document, ensure that it saves the document in UTF-8 encoding).

## Block-level elements

### Headers

vfmd supports both [setext]-style and [atx]-style headers.

[setext]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html
[atx]: http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/

#### setext-style headers

To create a setext-style header, follow the header text with an
line that "underlines" the text with equal signs (for first-level
headers) and dashes (for second-level headers).

For example:

    This is a first-level header
    ============================

    This is a second-level header
    -----------------------------

The "underline" line should start with a `=` or `-` character, can be of
any length, and can have interspersed space characters.

For example:

    This is a first-level header
    ==== == = =========== ======

    This is a second-level header
    ----

#### atx-style headers

atx-style headers start with one or more `#` characters. The first-level
header starts with a single `#`, second-level headers with `##`,
third-level headers with `###`, and so on, till 6 `#` characters for a
sixth-level header.

For example:

    # Title (first-level header)

    ## Section (second-level header)

    ### Subtitle (third-level header)

    ###### Sixth-level header

    ######### Still a sixth-level header

You may optionally "close" the header with any number of additional `#`
characters. However, the header level is determined only by counting the
"opening" `#` characters.

For example:

    ## Second-level header ##

    ### Third-level header ######

    ###### Sixth-level header #

### Code blocks

Code blocks can be used to quote text verbatim. For example, it can be
used to quote source code. Every line of the code block should be
indented by 4 space characters.

No Markdown syntax is processed within a code block. In addition, for
HTML output, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`) within a
code block are automatically converted into HTML entities, so that the
text appears as specified when the output HTML in viewed in a browser.

For example:

    Consider the following snippet that mixes Markdown with HTML5:

        ## Introduction

        This is <del>normal text</del> an intro.

becomes, in HTML output:

    <p>Consider the following snippet that mixes Markdown with HTML5:</p>

    <pre><code>## Introduction

    This is &lt;del&gt;normal text&lt;/del&gt; an intro.
    </pre></code>
